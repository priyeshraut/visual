🚀 **Just Wrapped Up My Movie Website Project!** 🎬

I recently built a **fully responsive movie website** using:
💻 **Tech Stack:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux and Google Firebase

✨ **Highlights of the Project:**

* 🎨 Designed a **modern & user-friendly UI** with Tailwind CSS
* 🔍 Added **search functionality** to quickly find movies & Tv shows
* ✨ Implemented a **shimmer loading effect** for a smooth experience while data loads
* 🔄 Added **infinite scrolling** for seamless content browsing without page reloads
* 🛠 Built **reusable components** for scalability and maintainability
* 🗂 Managed state efficiently with **Redux**
* 🛤 Implemented **dynamic routing** using React Router
* 🔐 Integrated **Google Firebase authentication** for secure login/signup
* ⚡ Created **custom hooks** to encapsulate and reuse logic
* 📱 Optimized for **all screen sizes** for a consistent viewing experience

This project was an incredible learning journey—combining **UI/UX design, state management, authentication, search, and performance optimization** into one complete application.
