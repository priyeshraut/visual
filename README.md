🚀 Just Wrapped Up My Movie Website Project! 🎬

I recently built a fully responsive movie website using:
💻 Tech Stack: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Google Firebase

✨ Highlights of the Project:

🎨 Designed a modern & user-friendly UI with Tailwind CSS

🛠 Built reusable components for scalability and maintainability

🗂 Managed state efficiently with Redux

🛤 Implemented dynamic routing using React Router

🔐 Integrated Google Firebase authentication for secure login/signup

⚡ Created custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic

📱 Optimized for all screen sizes for a smooth experience

This project was an incredible learning journey—combining UI/UX, state management, authentication, and performance optimization into one complete application.
